# Setting Up Your Dapp Local Environment

Here are the instructions you need to get the *Bicycles on the Blockchain* decentalized application (Dapp) up and running!




### Part I

1.  Go to your terminal. Don’t worry if it’s your first time using the command line! We’ll walk you through the process. 

* If you’re using Windows, [go here for instructions](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089) on how to use the command line. 

* If you have a Mac [go here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line).

* And I haven’t forgotten about you, Linux, [here are the instructions](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line) that will help you power up a command line on your machine.


2. [Install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer. If you’re curious, you can learn more about node [here](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-node)!


3. Go to the terminal and install truffle: `npm install -g truffle`. After you have finished      installing truffle be sure to keep the terminal open. We’re going to use it again.


### Part II

1. Download the code from this repo. Before you download the code, be sure to [install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine. Git is how you interact with the code on Github. You can learn about both Git and Github [here](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/git-and-github-what-s-the-difference/).

* Open a terminal. From your terminal type in `git clone https://github.com/pkafei/Bicycles-on-the-Blockchain`

2. You have the code, now it is time to install, [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/), a local blockchain, onto your machine.
